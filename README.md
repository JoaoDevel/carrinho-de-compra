# Shopping Cart with ReactJS ðŸ›’

This is a shopping cart application built to practice my skills with **ReactJS**. It utilizes the **Context API** to manage the global state, **React hooks** for handling state and effects, and consumes the **Mercado Livre API** to display available products. The project also incorporates **TailwindCSS** for styling.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Display a list of products fetched from the **Mercado Livre API**.
- Add and remove products from the cart.
- Dynamic updating of cart total and item count.
- Fully responsive design using **TailwindCSS**.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **ReactJS** for building the user interface.
- **Context API** for global state management.
- **Hooks** (useState, useEffect, useContext) for managing application state.
- **Mercado Livre API** to fetch product data.
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive and modern styling.
